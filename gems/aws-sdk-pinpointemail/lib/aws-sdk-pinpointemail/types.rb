    #             general label that acts as a category for a more specific tag value. A tag value acts as
    #             a descriptor within a tag key. A tag key can contain as many as 128 characters. A tag
    #             value can contain as many as 256 characters. The characters can be Unicode letters,
    #             digits, white space, or one of the following symbols: _ . : / = + -. The following
