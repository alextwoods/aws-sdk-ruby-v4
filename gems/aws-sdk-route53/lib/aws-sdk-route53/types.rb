    #   			         </li>
    #            </ul>
    #   		       <p>If you don't specify a value for <code>FullyQualifiedDomainName</code>, Route 53

    #   			checks the health of the endpoint.</p>
    #   		       <note>
    #   			         <p>If you don't specify a value for <code>IPAddress</code>, Route 53 uses only IPv4

    #   				of A for the name that you specify for <code>FullyQualifiedDomainName</code>, the
    #   				health check fails with a "DNS resolution failed" error.</p>

    #   		       <p>If you want to check the health of weighted, latency, or failover resource record sets

    #   			example, one resource record set for a continent and one for a country on the same
    #   			continent), priority goes to the smallest geographic region. This allows you to route

    #   				record set for which the value of <code>CountryCode</code> is <code>*</code>. Two
    #   				groups of queries are routed to the resource that you specify in this record:
    #   				queries that come from locations for which you haven't created geolocation resource
    #   				record sets and queries from IP addresses that aren't mapped to a location. If you
    #   				don't create a <code>*</code> resource record set, Route 53 returns a "no answer"
    #   				response for queries from those locations.</p>

    #   		       <note>
    #   			         <p>If you don't specify a value for <code>IPAddress</code>, Route 53 uses only IPv4

    #   			value of <code>FullyQualifiedDomainName</code>, specify the domain name of the server
    #   			(such as <code>us-east-2-www.example.com</code>), not the name of the resource record
