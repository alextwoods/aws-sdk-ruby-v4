    #                       updated with the latest fragments as they become available. We recommend that
    #                       the media player retrieve a new manifest on a one-second interval. When this
    #                       type of session is played in a media player, the user interface typically
    #                       displays a "live" notification, with no scrubber control for choosing the

    #                           a fragment is missing). A gap like this might cause a media player to halt
    #                           or cause a jump in playback. In this mode, fragments are not added to the
    #                           MPEG-DASH manifest if they are older than the newest fragment in the
    #                           playlist. If the missing fragment becomes available after a subsequent
    #                           fragment is added to the manifest, the older fragment is not added, and the

    #                       by including fragments from a given start time. Instead of fragments being added
