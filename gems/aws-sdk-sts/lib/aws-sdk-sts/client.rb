    # <p>Returns a set of temporary security credentials that you can use to access Amazon Web Services
    #          resources. These temporary credentials consist of an access key ID, a secret access key,
    #          and a security token. Typically, you use <code>AssumeRole</code> within your account or for
    #          cross-account access. For a comparison of <code>AssumeRole</code> with other API operations
    #          that produce temporary credentials, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp_request.html">Requesting Temporary Security

    #             <b>Permissions</b>
    #          </p>
    #          <p>The temporary security credentials created by <code>AssumeRole</code> can be used to
    #          make API calls to any Amazon Web Services service with the following exception: You cannot call the
    #          Amazon Web Services STS <code>GetFederationToken</code> or <code>GetSessionToken</code> API
    #          operations.</p>
    #          <p>(Optional) You can pass inline or managed <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies.html#policies_session">session policies</a> to
    #          this operation. You can pass a single JSON policy document to use as an inline session
    #          policy. You can also specify up to 10 managed policy Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) to use as
    #          managed session policies. The plaintext that you use for both inline and managed session
    #          policies can't exceed 2,048 characters. Passing policies to this operation returns new
    #          temporary credentials. The resulting session's permissions are the intersection of the
    #          role's identity-based policy and the session policies. You can use the role's temporary
    #          credentials in subsequent Amazon Web Services API calls to access resources in the account that owns
    #          the role. You cannot use session policies to grant more permissions than those allowed
    #          by the identity-based policy of the role that is being assumed. For more information, see
    #             <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies.html#policies_session">Session
    #             Policies</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>.</p>
    #          <p>When you create a role, you create two policies: A role trust policy that specifies
    #             <i>who</i> can assume the role and a permissions policy that specifies
    #             <i>what</i> can be done with the role. You specify the trusted principal
    #          who is allowed to assume the role in the role trust policy.</p>
    #          <p>To assume a role from a different account, your Amazon Web Services account must be trusted by the
    #          role. The trust relationship is defined in the role's trust policy when the role is
    #          created. That trust policy states which accounts are allowed to delegate that access to
    #          users in the account. </p>
    #          <p>A user who wants to access a role in a different account must also have permissions that
    #          are delegated from the user account administrator. The administrator must attach a policy
    #          that allows the user to call <code>AssumeRole</code> for the ARN of the role in the other
    #          account.</p>
    #          <p>To allow a user to assume a role in the same account, you can do either of the
    #          following:</p>
    #          <ul>
    #             <li>
    #                <p>Attach a policy to the user that allows the user to call <code>AssumeRole</code>
    #                (as long as the role's trust policy trusts the account).</p>
    #             </li>
    #             <li>
    #                <p>Add the user as a principal directly in the role's trust policy.</p>
    #             </li>
    #          </ul>
    #          <p>You can do either because the roleâ€™s trust policy acts as an IAM resource-based
    #          policy. When a resource-based policy grants access to a principal in the same account, no
    #          additional identity-based policy is required. For more information about trust policies and
    #          resource-based policies, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies.html">IAM Policies</a> in the
    #             <i>IAM User Guide</i>.</p>
    #          <p>
    #             <b>Tags</b>
    #          </p>
    #          <p>(Optional) You can pass tag key-value pairs to your session. These tags are called
    #          session tags. For more information about session tags, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_session-tags.html">Passing Session Tags in STS</a> in the
    #             <i>IAM User Guide</i>.</p>
    #          <p>An administrator must grant you the permissions necessary to pass session tags. The
    #          administrator can also create granular permissions to allow you to pass only specific
    #          session tags. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/tutorial_attribute-based-access-control.html">Tutorial: Using Tags
    #             for Attribute-Based Access Control</a> in the
    #          <i>IAM User Guide</i>.</p>
    #          <p>You can set the session tags as transitive. Transitive tags persist during role
    #          chaining. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_session-tags.html#id_session-tags_role-chaining">Chaining Roles

    #          <p>
    #             <b>Using MFA with AssumeRole</b>
    #          </p>
    #          <p>(Optional) You can include multi-factor authentication (MFA) information when you call
    #             <code>AssumeRole</code>. This is useful for cross-account scenarios to ensure that the
    #          user that assumes the role has been authenticated with an Amazon Web Services MFA device. In that
    #          scenario, the trust policy of the role being assumed includes a condition that tests for
    #          MFA authentication. If the caller does not include valid MFA information, the request to
    #          assume the role is denied. The condition in a trust policy that tests for MFA
    #          authentication might look like the following example.</p>
    #          <p>
    #             <code>"Condition": {"Bool": {"aws:MultiFactorAuthPresent": true}}</code>
    #          </p>
    #          <p>For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/MFAProtectedAPI.html">Configuring MFA-Protected API Access</a>
    #          in the <i>IAM User Guide</i> guide.</p>
    #          <p>To use MFA with <code>AssumeRole</code>, you pass values for the
    #             <code>SerialNumber</code> and <code>TokenCode</code> parameters. The
    #             <code>SerialNumber</code> value identifies the user's hardware or virtual MFA device.
    #          The <code>TokenCode</code> is the time-based one-time password (TOTP) that the MFA device
    #          produces. </p>
    #
    # @param [Hash] params
    #   See {Types::AssumeRoleInput}.
    #
    # @option params [String] :role_arn
    #   <p>The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the role to assume.</p>
    #
    # @option params [String] :role_session_name
    #   <p>An identifier for the assumed role session.</p>
    #            <p>Use the role session name to uniquely identify a session when the same role is assumed
    #            by different principals or for different reasons. In cross-account scenarios, the role
    #            session name is visible to, and can be logged by the account that owns the role. The role
    #            session name is also used in the ARN of the assumed role principal. This means that
    #            subsequent cross-account API requests that use the temporary security credentials will
    #            expose the role session name to the external account in their CloudTrail logs.</p>
    #            <p>The regex used to validate this parameter is a string of characters
    #       consisting of upper- and lower-case alphanumeric characters with no spaces. You can
    #       also include underscores or any of the following characters: =,.@-</p>
    #
    # @option params [Array<PolicyDescriptorType>] :policy_arns
    #   <p>The Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) of the IAM managed policies that you want to use as
    #            managed session policies. The policies must exist in the same account as the role.</p>
    #            <p>This parameter is optional. You can provide up to 10 managed policy ARNs. However, the
    #            plaintext that you use for both inline and managed session policies can't exceed 2,048

    # @option params [Integer] :duration_seconds
    #   <p>The duration, in seconds, of the role session. The value specified can range from 900
    #            seconds (15 minutes) up to the maximum session duration set for the role. The maximum
    #            session duration setting can have a value from 1 hour to 12 hours. If you specify a value
    #            higher than this setting or the administrator setting (whichever is lower), the operation
    #            fails. For example, if you specify a session duration of 12 hours, but your administrator
    #            set the maximum session duration to 6 hours, your operation fails. </p>
    #            <p>Role chaining limits your Amazon Web Services CLI or Amazon Web Services API role session to a maximum of one hour.
    #            When you use the <code>AssumeRole</code> API operation to assume a role, you can specify
    #            the duration of your role session with the <code>DurationSeconds</code> parameter. You can
    #            specify a parameter value of up to 43200 seconds (12 hours), depending on the maximum
    #            session duration setting for your role. However, if you assume a role using role chaining
    #            and provide a <code>DurationSeconds</code> parameter value greater than one hour, the

    #            <p>Tag keyâ€“value pairs are not case sensitive, but case is preserved. This means that you
    #            cannot have separate <code>Department</code> and <code>department</code> tag keys. Assume

    #          role session lasts for the duration that you specify, or until the time specified in the

    #          shorter. You can provide a <code>DurationSeconds</code> value from 900 seconds (15 minutes)
    #          up to the maximum session duration setting for the role. This setting can have a value from
    #          1 hour to 12 hours. To learn how to view the maximum value for your role, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_use.html#id_roles_use_view-role-max-session">View the
    #             Maximum Session Duration Setting for a Role</a> in the

    #             <b>Permissions</b>
    #          </p>
    #          <p>The temporary security credentials created by <code>AssumeRoleWithSAML</code> can be
    #          used to make API calls to any Amazon Web Services service with the following exception: you cannot call
    #          the STS <code>GetFederationToken</code> or <code>GetSessionToken</code> API
    #          operations.</p>
    #          <p>(Optional) You can pass inline or managed <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies.html#policies_session">session policies</a> to
    #          this operation. You can pass a single JSON policy document to use as an inline session
    #          policy. You can also specify up to 10 managed policy Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) to use as
    #          managed session policies. The plaintext that you use for both inline and managed session
    #          policies can't exceed 2,048 characters. Passing policies to this operation returns new
    #          temporary credentials. The resulting session's permissions are the intersection of the
    #          role's identity-based policy and the session policies. You can use the role's temporary
    #          credentials in subsequent Amazon Web Services API calls to access resources in the account that owns
    #          the role. You cannot use session policies to grant more permissions than those allowed
    #          by the identity-based policy of the role that is being assumed. For more information, see

    #          <p>Calling <code>AssumeRoleWithSAML</code> does not require the use of Amazon Web Services security
    #          credentials. The identity of the caller is validated by using keys in the metadata document
    #          that is uploaded for the SAML provider entity for your identity provider. </p>
    #          <important>
    #             <p>Calling <code>AssumeRoleWithSAML</code> can result in an entry in your CloudTrail logs.
    #             The entry includes the value in the <code>NameID</code> element of the SAML assertion.
    #             We recommend that you use a <code>NameIDType</code> that is not associated with any
    #             personally identifiable information (PII). For example, you could instead use the
    #             persistent identifier

    #          <p>(Optional) You can configure your IdP to pass attributes into your SAML assertion as
    #          session tags. Each session tag consists of a key name and an associated value. For more

    #          must use Identity and Access Management (IAM) to create a SAML provider entity in your Amazon Web Services account that

    #
    # @option params [Integer] :duration_seconds
    #   <p>The duration, in seconds, of the role session. Your role session lasts for the duration
    #            that you specify for the <code>DurationSeconds</code> parameter, or until the time
    #            specified in the SAML authentication response's <code>SessionNotOnOrAfter</code> value,
    #            whichever is shorter. You can provide a <code>DurationSeconds</code> value from 900 seconds
    #            (15 minutes) up to the maximum session duration setting for the role. This setting can have
    #            a value from 1 hour to 12 hours. If you specify a value higher than this setting, the
    #            operation fails. For example, if you specify a session duration of 12 hours, but your
    #            administrator set the maximum session duration to 6 hours, your operation fails. To learn
    #            how to view the maximum value for your role, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_use.html#id_roles_use_view-role-max-session">View the

    #          <note>
    #             <p>For mobile applications, we recommend that you use Amazon Cognito. You can use Amazon Cognito with the
    #                <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/sdkforios/">Amazon Web Services SDK for iOS Developer Guide</a> and the <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/sdkforandroid/">Amazon Web Services SDK for Android Developer Guide</a> to uniquely
    #             identify a user. You can also supply the user with a consistent identity throughout the
    #             lifetime of an application.</p>
    #             <p>To learn more about Amazon Cognito, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/mobile/sdkforandroid/developerguide/cognito-auth.html#d0e840">Amazon Cognito Overview</a> in

    #          </note>
    #          <p>Calling <code>AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity</code> does not require the use of Amazon Web Services
    #          security credentials. Therefore, you can distribute an application (for example, on mobile
    #          devices) that requests temporary security credentials without including long-term Amazon Web Services
    #          credentials in the application. You also don't need to deploy server-based proxy services
    #          that use long-term Amazon Web Services credentials. Instead, the identity of the caller is validated by
    #          using a token from the web identity provider. For a comparison of
    #             <code>AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity</code> with the other API operations that produce
    #          temporary credentials, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp_request.html">Requesting Temporary Security
    #             Credentials</a> and <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp_request.html#stsapi_comparison">Comparing the
    #             Amazon Web Services STS API operations</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>.</p>
    #          <p>The temporary security credentials returned by this API consist of an access key ID, a
    #          secret access key, and a security token. Applications can use these temporary security
    #          credentials to sign calls to Amazon Web Services service API operations.</p>
    #          <p>
    #             <b>Session Duration</b>
    #          </p>
    #          <p>By default, the temporary security credentials created by
    #             <code>AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity</code> last for one hour. However, you can use the
    #          optional <code>DurationSeconds</code> parameter to specify the duration of your session.
    #          You can provide a value from 900 seconds (15 minutes) up to the maximum session duration
    #          setting for the role. This setting can have a value from 1 hour to 12 hours. To learn how
    #          to view the maximum value for your role, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_use.html#id_roles_use_view-role-max-session">View the
    #             Maximum Session Duration Setting for a Role</a> in the
    #             <i>IAM User Guide</i>. The maximum session duration limit applies when
    #          you use the <code>AssumeRole*</code> API operations or the <code>assume-role*</code> CLI
    #          commands. However the limit does not apply when you use those operations to create a
    #          console URL. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_use.html">Using IAM Roles</a> in the

    #             <b>Permissions</b>
    #          </p>
    #          <p>The temporary security credentials created by <code>AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity</code> can
    #          be used to make API calls to any Amazon Web Services service with the following exception: you cannot
    #          call the STS <code>GetFederationToken</code> or <code>GetSessionToken</code> API
    #          operations.</p>
    #          <p>(Optional) You can pass inline or managed <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies.html#policies_session">session policies</a> to
    #          this operation. You can pass a single JSON policy document to use as an inline session
    #          policy. You can also specify up to 10 managed policy Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) to use as
    #          managed session policies. The plaintext that you use for both inline and managed session
    #          policies can't exceed 2,048 characters. Passing policies to this operation returns new
    #          temporary credentials. The resulting session's permissions are the intersection of the
    #          role's identity-based policy and the session policies. You can use the role's temporary
    #          credentials in subsequent Amazon Web Services API calls to access resources in the account that owns
    #          the role. You cannot use session policies to grant more permissions than those allowed
    #          by the identity-based policy of the role that is being assumed. For more information, see

    #             <b>Tags</b>
    #          </p>
    #          <p>(Optional) You can configure your IdP to pass attributes into your web identity token as
    #          session tags. Each session tag consists of a key name and an associated value. For more
    #          information about session tags, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_session-tags.html">Passing Session Tags in STS</a> in the
    #             <i>IAM User Guide</i>.</p>
    #          <p>You can pass up to 50 session tags. The plaintext session tag keys canâ€™t exceed 128
    #          characters and the values canâ€™t exceed 256 characters. For these and additional limits, see

    #          </note>
    #          <p>You can pass a session tag with the same key as a tag that is attached to the role. When

    #          <p>An administrator must grant you the permissions necessary to pass session tags. The
    #          administrator can also create granular permissions to allow you to pass only specific

    #             <b>Identities</b>
    #          </p>
    #          <p>Before your application can call <code>AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity</code>, you must have
    #          an identity token from a supported identity provider and create a role that the application
    #          can assume. The role that your application assumes must trust the identity provider that is
    #          associated with the identity token. In other words, the identity provider must be specified
    #          in the role's trust policy. </p>
    #          <important>
    #             <p>Calling <code>AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity</code> can result in an entry in your
    #             CloudTrail logs. The entry includes the <a href="http://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#Claims">Subject</a> of
    #             the provided web identity token. We recommend that you avoid using any personally
    #             identifiable information (PII) in this field. For example, you could instead use a GUID

    #             <p>Only certain Amazon Web Services operations return an encoded authorization message. The

    # <p>Returns a set of temporary security credentials (consisting of an access key ID, a
    #          secret access key, and a security token) for a federated user. A typical use is in a proxy
    #          application that gets temporary security credentials on behalf of distributed applications
    #          inside a corporate network. You must call the <code>GetFederationToken</code> operation
    #          using the long-term security credentials of an IAM user. As a result, this call is
    #          appropriate in contexts where those credentials can be safely stored, usually in a
    #          server-based application. For a comparison of <code>GetFederationToken</code> with the
    #          other API operations that produce temporary credentials, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp_request.html">Requesting Temporary Security
    #             Credentials</a> and <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp_request.html#stsapi_comparison">Comparing the
    #             Amazon Web Services STS API operations</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>.</p>
    #          <note>
    #             <p>You can create a mobile-based or browser-based app that can authenticate users using
    #             a web identity provider like Login with Amazon, Facebook, Google, or an OpenID
    #             Connect-compatible identity provider. In this case, we recommend that you use <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/cognito/">Amazon Cognito</a> or
    #                <code>AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity</code>. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp_request.html#api_assumerolewithwebidentity">Federation Through a Web-based Identity Provider</a> in the

    #          </note>
    #          <p>You can also call <code>GetFederationToken</code> using the security credentials of an
    #          Amazon Web Services account root user, but we do not recommend it. Instead, we recommend that you create
    #          an IAM user for the purpose of the proxy application. Then attach a policy to the IAM
    #          user that limits federated users to only the actions and resources that they need to
    #          access. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/best-practices.html">IAM Best Practices</a> in the
    #             <i>IAM User Guide</i>. </p>
    #          <p>
    #             <b>Session duration</b>
    #          </p>
    #          <p>The temporary credentials are valid for the specified duration, from 900 seconds (15
    #          minutes) up to a maximum of 129,600 seconds (36 hours). The default session duration is
    #          43,200 seconds (12 hours). Temporary credentials obtained by using the Amazon Web Services account root
    #          user credentials have a maximum duration of 3,600 seconds (1 hour).</p>
    #          <p>
    #             <b>Permissions</b>
    #          </p>
    #          <p>You can use the temporary credentials created by <code>GetFederationToken</code> in any
    #          Amazon Web Services service with the following exceptions:</p>
    #          <ul>
    #             <li>
    #                <p>You cannot call any IAM operations using the CLI or the Amazon Web Services API. This limitation does not apply to console sessions.</p>
    #             </li>
    #             <li>
    #                <p>You cannot call any STS operations except <code>GetCallerIdentity</code>.</p>
    #             </li>
    #          </ul>
    #          <p>You can use temporary credentials for single sign-on (SSO) to the console.</p>
    #          <p>You must pass an inline or managed <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies.html#policies_session">session policy</a> to
    #          this operation. You can pass a single JSON policy document to use as an inline session
    #          policy. You can also specify up to 10 managed policy Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) to use as
    #          managed session policies. The plaintext that you use for both inline and managed session
    #          policies can't exceed 2,048 characters.</p>
    #          <p>Though the session policy parameters are optional, if you do not pass a policy, then the
    #          resulting federated user session has no permissions. When you pass session policies, the
    #          session permissions are the intersection of the IAM user policies and the session
    #          policies that you pass. This gives you a way to further restrict the permissions for a
    #          federated user. You cannot use session policies to grant more permissions than those that
    #          are defined in the permissions policy of the IAM user. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies.html#policies_session">Session
    #             Policies</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>. For information about
    #          using <code>GetFederationToken</code> to create temporary security credentials, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp_request.html#api_getfederationtoken">GetFederationTokenâ€”Federation Through a Custom Identity Broker</a>. </p>
    #          <p>You can use the credentials to access a resource that has a resource-based policy. If
    #          that policy specifically references the federated user session in the
    #             <code>Principal</code> element of the policy, the session has the permissions allowed by
    #          the policy. These permissions are granted in addition to the permissions granted by the
    #          session policies.</p>
    #          <p>
    #             <b>Tags</b>
    #          </p>
    #          <p>(Optional) You can pass tag key-value pairs to your session. These are called session
    #          tags. For more information about session tags, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_session-tags.html">Passing Session Tags in STS</a> in the
    #             <i>IAM User Guide</i>.</p>
    #          <note>
    #             <p>You can create a mobile-based or browser-based app that can authenticate users using

    #          </note>
    #          <p>An administrator must grant you the permissions necessary to pass session tags. The
    #          administrator can also create granular permissions to allow you to pass only specific
    #          session tags. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/tutorial_attribute-based-access-control.html">Tutorial: Using Tags

    #          that the user that you are federating has the
    #             <code>Department</code>=<code>Marketing</code> tag and you pass the

    # <p>Returns a set of temporary credentials for an Amazon Web Services account or IAM user. The
    #          credentials consist of an access key ID, a secret access key, and a security token.
    #          Typically, you use <code>GetSessionToken</code> if you want to use MFA to protect
    #          programmatic calls to specific Amazon Web Services API operations like Amazon EC2 <code>StopInstances</code>.
    #          MFA-enabled IAM users would need to call <code>GetSessionToken</code> and submit an MFA
    #          code that is associated with their MFA device. Using the temporary security credentials
    #          that are returned from the call, IAM users can then make programmatic calls to API
    #          operations that require MFA authentication. If you do not supply a correct MFA code, then
    #          the API returns an access denied error. For a comparison of <code>GetSessionToken</code>
    #          with the other API operations that produce temporary credentials, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp_request.html">Requesting
    #             Temporary Security Credentials</a> and <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp_request.html#stsapi_comparison">Comparing the
    #             Amazon Web Services STS API operations</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>.</p>
    #          <note>
    #             <p>No permissions are required for users to perform this operation. The purpose of the
    #                <code>sts:GetSessionToken</code> operation is to authenticate the user using MFA. You
    #             cannot use policies to control authentication operations. For more information, see
    #                <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp_control-access_getsessiontoken.html">Permissions for GetSessionToken</a> in the

    #             <b>Session Duration</b>
    #          </p>
    #          <p>The <code>GetSessionToken</code> operation must be called by using the long-term Amazon Web Services
    #          security credentials of the Amazon Web Services account root user or an IAM user. Credentials that are
    #          created by IAM users are valid for the duration that you specify. This duration can range
    #          from 900 seconds (15 minutes) up to a maximum of 129,600 seconds (36 hours), with a default
    #          of 43,200 seconds (12 hours). Credentials based on account credentials can range from 900
    #          seconds (15 minutes) up to 3,600 seconds (1 hour), with a default of 1 hour. </p>
    #          <p>
    #             <b>Permissions</b>
    #          </p>
    #          <p>The temporary security credentials created by <code>GetSessionToken</code> can be used
    #          to make API calls to any Amazon Web Services service with the following exceptions:</p>
    #          <ul>
    #             <li>
    #                <p>You cannot call any IAM API operations unless MFA authentication information is
    #                included in the request.</p>
    #             </li>
    #             <li>
    #                <p>You cannot call any STS API <i>except</i>
    #                   <code>AssumeRole</code> or <code>GetCallerIdentity</code>.</p>
    #             </li>
    #          </ul>
    #          <note>
    #             <p>We recommend that you do not call <code>GetSessionToken</code> with Amazon Web Services account
    #             root user credentials. Instead, follow our <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/best-practices.html#create-iam-users">best practices</a> by
    #             creating one or more IAM users, giving them the necessary permissions, and using IAM
    #             users for everyday interaction with Amazon Web Services. </p>
    #          </note>
    #          <p>The credentials that are returned by <code>GetSessionToken</code> are based on
    #          permissions associated with the user whose credentials were used to call the operation. If
    #             <code>GetSessionToken</code> is called using Amazon Web Services account root user credentials, the
    #          temporary credentials have root user permissions. Similarly, if
    #             <code>GetSessionToken</code> is called using the credentials of an IAM user, the
    #          temporary credentials have the same permissions as the IAM user. </p>
    #          <p>For more information about using <code>GetSessionToken</code> to create temporary
    #          credentials, go to <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp_request.html#api_getsessiontoken">Temporary

    # @param [Hash] params
    #   See {Types::GetSessionTokenInput}.
    #
    # @option params [Integer] :duration_seconds
    #   <p>The duration, in seconds, that the credentials should remain valid. Acceptable durations
    #            for IAM user sessions range from 900 seconds (15 minutes) to 129,600 seconds (36 hours),
    #            with 43,200 seconds (12 hours) as the default. Sessions for Amazon Web Services account owners are
    #            restricted to a maximum of 3,600 seconds (one hour). If the duration is longer than one
    #            hour, the session for Amazon Web Services account owners defaults to one hour.</p>
    #
    # @option params [String] :serial_number
    #   <p>The identification number of the MFA device that is associated with the IAM user who
    #            is making the <code>GetSessionToken</code> call. Specify this value if the IAM user has a
    #            policy that requires MFA authentication. The value is either the serial number for a
    #            hardware device (such as <code>GAHT12345678</code>) or an Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for a
    #            virtual device (such as <code>arn:aws:iam::123456789012:mfa/user</code>). You can find the
    #            device for an IAM user by going to the Amazon Web Services Management Console and viewing the user's security
    #            credentials. </p>
    #            <p>The regex used to validate this parameter is a string of
    #       characters consisting of upper- and lower-case alphanumeric characters with no spaces.
    #       You can also include underscores or any of the following characters: =,.@:/-</p>
    #
    # @option params [String] :token_code
    #   <p>The value provided by the MFA device, if MFA is required. If any policy requires the
    #            IAM user to submit an MFA code, specify this value. If MFA authentication is required,
    #            the user must provide a code when requesting a set of temporary security credentials. A
    #            user who fails to provide the code receives an "access denied" response when requesting
    #            resources that require MFA authentication.</p>
    #            <p>The format for this parameter, as described by its regex pattern, is a sequence of six
    #            numeric digits.</p>
