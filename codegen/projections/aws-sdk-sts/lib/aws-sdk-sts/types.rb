    # @!attribute role_session_name
    #   <p>An identifier for the assumed role session.</p>
    #            <p>Use the role session name to uniquely identify a session when the same role is assumed
    #            by different principals or for different reasons. In cross-account scenarios, the role
    #            session name is visible to, and can be logged by the account that owns the role. The role
    #            session name is also used in the ARN of the assumed role principal. This means that
    #            subsequent cross-account API requests that use the temporary security credentials will
    #            expose the role session name to the external account in their CloudTrail logs.</p>
    #            <p>The regex used to validate this parameter is a string of characters
    #       consisting of upper- and lower-case alphanumeric characters with no spaces. You can

    #   <p>The Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) of the IAM managed policies that you want to use as
    #            managed session policies. The policies must exist in the same account as the role.</p>
    #            <p>This parameter is optional. You can provide up to 10 managed policy ARNs. However, the
    #            plaintext that you use for both inline and managed session policies can't exceed 2,048

    # @!attribute duration_seconds
    #   <p>The duration, in seconds, of the role session. The value specified can range from 900
    #            seconds (15 minutes) up to the maximum session duration set for the role. The maximum
    #            session duration setting can have a value from 1 hour to 12 hours. If you specify a value
    #            higher than this setting or the administrator setting (whichever is lower), the operation
    #            fails. For example, if you specify a session duration of 12 hours, but your administrator
    #            set the maximum session duration to 6 hours, your operation fails. </p>
    #            <p>Role chaining limits your Amazon Web Services CLI or Amazon Web Services API role session to a maximum of one hour.
    #            When you use the <code>AssumeRole</code> API operation to assume a role, you can specify
    #            the duration of your role session with the <code>DurationSeconds</code> parameter. You can
    #            specify a parameter value of up to 43200 seconds (12 hours), depending on the maximum
    #            session duration setting for your role. However, if you assume a role using role chaining
    #            and provide a <code>DurationSeconds</code> parameter value greater than one hour, the
    #            operation fails. To learn how to view the maximum value for your role, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_use.html id_roles_use_view-role-max-session">View the

    #            <p>By default, the value is set to <code>3600</code> seconds. </p>
    #            <note>
    #               <p>The <code>DurationSeconds</code> parameter is separate from the duration of a console
    #               session that you might request using the returned credentials. The request to the
    #               federation endpoint for a console sign-in token takes a <code>SessionDuration</code>
    #               parameter that specifies the maximum length of the console session. For more

    #            <p>This parameter is optional. You can pass up to 50 session tags. The plaintext session
    #            tag keys can’t exceed 128 characters, and the values can’t exceed 256 characters. For these

    #            </note>
    #
    #            <p>You can pass a session tag with the same key as a tag that is already attached to the
    #            role. When you do, session tags override a role tag with the same key. </p>
    #            <p>Tag key–value pairs are not case sensitive, but case is preserved. This means that you
    #            cannot have separate <code>Department</code> and <code>department</code> tag keys. Assume
    #            that the role has the <code>Department</code>=<code>Marketing</code> tag and you pass the
    #               <code>department</code>=<code>engineering</code> session tag. <code>Department</code>
    #            and <code>department</code> are not saved as separate tags, and the session tag passed in
    #            the request takes precedence over the role tag.</p>
    #            <p>Additionally, if you used temporary credentials to perform this operation, the new
    #            session inherits any transitive session tags from the calling session. If you pass a
    #            session tag with the same key as an inherited tag, the operation fails. To view the
    #            inherited tags for a session, see the CloudTrail logs. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/session-tags.html id_session-tags_ctlogs">Viewing Session Tags in CloudTrail</a> in the

    #
    #   @return [Array<Tag>]
    #
    # @!attribute transitive_tag_keys
    #   <p>A list of keys for session tags that you want to set as transitive. If you set a tag key
    #            as transitive, the corresponding key and value passes to subsequent sessions in a role
    #            chain. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_session-tags.html id_session-tags_role-chaining">Chaining Roles
    #               with Session Tags</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>.</p>
    #            <p>This parameter is optional. When you set session tags as transitive, the session policy
    #            and session tags packed binary limit is not affected.</p>
    #            <p>If you choose not to specify a transitive tag key, then no tags are passed from this

    #
    #   @return [Array<String>]
    #
    # @!attribute external_id
    #   <p>A unique identifier that might be required when you assume a role in another account. If
    #            the administrator of the account to which the role belongs provided you with an external
    #            ID, then provide that value in the <code>ExternalId</code> parameter. This value can be any
    #            string, such as a passphrase or account number. A cross-account role is usually set up to
    #            trust everyone in an account. Therefore, the administrator of the trusting account might
    #            send an external ID to the administrator of the trusted account. That way, only someone
    #            with the ID can assume the role, rather than everyone in the account. For more information
    #            about the external ID, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_create_for-user_externalid.html">How to Use an External ID
